# Buffer Clone

I built this project as part of the Go Rails [Ruby on Rails for Beginners course](https://gorails.com/start).

Over 41 tutorials, I learnt Ruby on Rails by building a Buffer clone (to schedule Tweets) with authentication, OAuth, Twitterâ€™s API, and background workers.

It uses:
- Ruby 3.0
- Rails 6.1
- Bootstrap
- Postgres
- Sidekiq
